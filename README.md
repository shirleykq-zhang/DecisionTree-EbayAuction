# DecisionTree-EbayAuction

Given the historical data of auctions on eBay.com during May-June 2004, We are interested in
developing a model which predicts and classifies auctions as competitive or non-competitive. The
dataset contains 8 variables and 1,972 observations. The variables describe the item (auction category),
theseller (their eBay rating), the auction terms that the seller selected (auction duration,opening price,
currency, day-of-week of auction close) and the resulting closing price. Using this data, we build a
Classification Tree Model to uncover insights related to the competitiveness of eBay auctions.
